# Retail-Marketing-Analytics
The Global Superstore dataset contains data on order details of customers for orders from the superstore . This includes the profit, sales revenue, state, region, order date, shipping date, product ordered etc.

An analysis of data from different customers using our previous records will help us understand the past sales transactions records of the company  in a broader way and make amends to improve the revenue of the organization and enhance the customer experience.

In this project, we will also develop an understanding of sales analytics in retail and marketing services and understand how data is used to maximize the revenue of the company.
